Ever came accross a crap-cake and asked yourself, 
"ah yes, If only I knew what animal holds the ownership title to this ensemble of used biomolecules?"

Well, here lies the solution. This python script recognizes the culprit of that weirdly scented poop, and tells you the animal who excreted the poop. 

Next time you are on an adventure, you won't need no guide to tell you that- what you stepped on has once passed through an elephant. This deeplearning based model does that for you!

Although right now it only classifies between cat, elephant and dog's feces. Different dataset will be added soon.
